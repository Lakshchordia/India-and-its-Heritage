            <h2><u>The Government of India</u></h2> 
        <p>The Government of India (ISO: Bhārat Sarkār; often abbreviated as GoI), also known as the Union Government, 
            the Central Government or simply the Centre, is the national authority of the Republic of India, a federal democracy located 
            in South Asia, consisting of 28 union states and eight union territories. The government, seated in New Delhi, has three primary branches:
             <i> legislative, executive</i> and <i>judiciary</i> whose powers are vested in a bicameral Parliament, a prime minister, and the Supreme Court respectively, with a president as head of state. 
             Through judicial evolution, the Parliament has lost its sovereignty as its amendments to the Constitution are subject to judicial intervention. Judicial appointments are made with negligible say from the executive or legislature.</p>
